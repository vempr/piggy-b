# piggy-b

is a mouse-only game, where your objective is to drag the coin into your piggy bank
for every level. Sounds too easy, until you realize that the movement is not so
intuitive and that your attempts are very limited.

For anyone wondering: the weird looking theme/enemies of this game are from
Hack Club and particularly one of it's events, Siege. Have fun (raging)!
